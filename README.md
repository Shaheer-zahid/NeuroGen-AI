# NeuroGen-AI
**AI-Powered System for Automated Model Optimization**

NeuroGen is an advanced AI system designed to automate the selection, tuning, and optimization of machine learning and deep learning models. Built for adaptability and performance, it intelligently refines model architectures and hyperparameters using Reinforcement Learning, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and Bayesian Optimization. NeuroGen significantly reduces manual overhead and ensures scalable, high-performing solutions for classification and sentiment analysis tasks.
